      The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution.
      Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent<br>,
      economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and
      civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took<br>
      on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian
      Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned<br>
      British Raj into Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan India
      remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of<br>
      India established the Republic of India. Pakistan remained a dominion
      until 1956 when it adopted its first constitution. In 1971, East Pakistan<br>
      declared its own independence as Bangladesh.
